            <h2>// about</h2>
            <p>Hades is a roguelike action dunger crawler in which you play as Zagreus, the son of Hades and prince of the Underworld, trying to escape said Underworld with the aid of the Olympians, who are under the belief that Zagreus intends to live with them at Mount Olympus (does he?). Using of great Greek mythology accuracy, no run is the same, challenging the player between different types of monsters, Elysium champions under Hades' orders, and even Tartarus itself changing its chambers in order to prevent anyone and anything of leaving.</p>
            <p>In the mention of in-game deaths, each time the player dies, Zagreus is taken away by the River Styx back to the House of Hades, where each and every character you talk to acknowledges yet another escape attempt (or insults you, in case of Great Old Dad), giving you tips and developing friendship (or more, depending on which characters we are talking about), allowing the player to find out more about the game's lore and earn accessories that will aid to not die so easily next run (because, let's be real, you'll die <i>a lot</i>). All the in-between runs dialogues and activities (which you <i>can</i> choose not to do, but I honestly can't see why you'd do that) works wonderfully to take away the weight of having to start yet another run all over again, since, once the player dies, they'll most likely think "nice, I get to talk to Achilles and pet Cerberus again" than "blood and darkness, I have to start all over again, <i>yet again</i>."</p>
            <p>And yes, <b>you can pet Cerberus</b>. The most incredible game mechanic in all history. Along with fishing, of course.</can></p>

            <h2>// characters</h2>
            <p>First of all I just want to make it clear I am absolutely not adding every single character here, since this <i>is</i> an assignment and not actually a Wiki blog. I just needed to content to fill this website and I thought "why not talk about my currently favorite game?" (actually this was a friend's suggestion, but you get the point) But since I need to use lists somehow I thought to do a rank of my favorite characters and the reasons for that. So here it is.</p>
            <div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col">
                        <h3>My most hated characters, ranked (because why not)</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Theseus</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>He talks with the same pomposity as the Olympians even though he's just another shade.</li>
                                <li>He acts like he's won every single fight (which is a absolute lie).</li>
                                <li>He's mean to Asterious.</li>
                                <li>Seriously just <s><i>[beep]</i></s> him.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>When you don't choose her, the way she talks is the same way an abusive partner would (which makes sense considering her historic and what she's the goddess of).</li>
                                <li>Her call doesn't do much, but when Theseus calls her it's a killing machine.</li>
                                <li>She didn't pass the vibe check.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>They're all so different and they're all voiced by the same guy. I have known this fact for about four months and I have yet to fully process it.</li>
                                <li>Darren Korb is also the solo creator of all music and sounds of all Supergiant's games, including but not exclusive to Hades.</li>

                                <li>(Spoiler alert!) The interpretation when Zagreus first finds out that Nyx is not his birth mother and she says "Oh, my dear child... So now you know? So now you know." Absolutely heartbreaking.</li>
